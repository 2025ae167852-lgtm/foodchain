Build a full-stack web application called “Unified Farm Intelligence Platform (UFIP)”.

Core concept:
The Farmer’s Calendar is the brain of the system, providing GPS- and climate-based farm advisories and activity logging.
Blockchain is the backbone of the system, storing immutable proofs of farm activities, carbon data, and food traceability records.

User roles:
1. Farmer
2. Processor
3. Retailer
4. Input Provider
5. Financial Provider
6. Regulatory Agency
7. Public Consumer (read-only via QR scan)

Main services (integrated into one app):

SERVICE 1: Climate-Smart Farmer’s Calendar (Primary Interface)
- Farmers register farm plots using GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude).
- The calendar generates seasonal, climate-based advisories using weather data and crop type.
- Advisories include planting, irrigation, fertilizer timing, pest/disease alerts, and harvest guidance.
- Farmers log daily farm activities through the calendar (planting, spraying, irrigation, harvesting).
- The calendar adapts dynamically based on rainfall, temperature, and seasonal forecasts.
- The calendar is the main data input point for the entire system.

SERVICE 2: Blockchain Food Traceability (Backbone)
- Each farm plot and harvest creates a unique Batch ID.
- All critical events (planting, harvest, processing, transport, storage) are recorded as traceability events.
- Event data is stored in a database and documents/photos are stored on IPFS.
- Hashes of Batch IDs, event records, and IPFS CIDs are written to the blockchain using smart contracts.
- A QR code is generated for each batch so buyers, regulators, and consumers can view the full farm-to-fork history.
- Blockchain data is immutable and verifiable.

SERVICE 3: Carbon Footprint & Carbon Credit Tracking
- Carbon calculations are automatically derived from farm activities logged in the Farmer’s Calendar.
- Emissions are calculated per batch using standard carbon methodologies.
- A digital carbon certificate is generated for each batch.
- The hash of the carbon certificate is anchored to the blockchain and linked to the batch.
- Carbon data is viewable by farmers, buyers, financial institutions, and regulators.

Dashboards by role:
- Farmer dashboard: calendar, advisories, map view, activity logging, batch list, carbon summary.
- Processor dashboard: batch intake, processing events, document uploads.
- Retailer dashboard: product verification, traceability views, sustainability data.
- Input provider dashboard: advisory alignment and input recommendations.
- Financial provider dashboard: verified production data and carbon metrics.
- Regulator dashboard: audit-ready traceability and compliance data.
- Consumer view: QR code scan to see product origin, farm story, and carbon footprint.

Technical requirements:
- Frontend: web app with role-based access.
- Backend: API with write protection and role permissions.
- Storage: database for fast queries, IPFS for documents.
- Blockchain: smart contracts store hashes only (batch IDs, trace events, carbon certificates).
- The system reconciles database records with blockchain records to ensure integrity.

Goal:
Create a unified, blockchain-backed agricultural platform where the farmer’s calendar drives intelligence, and blockchain guarantees trust across the entire food supply chain.
